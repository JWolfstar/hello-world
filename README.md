# hello-world

how funny would it be if someone made a shoe-shaped car? i mean personally i dont have the funds or determination to make it happen myself,
but if i was walking down the street and saw a giant shoe moving down the road i think it would make my day.

bonus points if you can make a pun based on "vans"
